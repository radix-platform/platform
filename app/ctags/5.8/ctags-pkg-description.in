# HOW TO EDIT THIS FILE:
# The "handy ruler" below makes it easier to edit a package description.  Line
# up the first '|' above the ':' following the base package name, and the '|'
# on the right side marks the last column you can put a character in.  You must
# make exactly 11 lines for the formatting to be correct.  It's also
# customary to leave one space after the ':'.

ctags: ctags @VERSION@ (Exuberant Ctags)
ctags:
ctags: Exuberant Ctags is a multilanguage reimplementation of the
ctags: much-underused ctags(1) program and is intended to be the mother of
ctags: all ctags programs. It generates indexes of source code definitions
ctags: which are used by a number of editors and tools. The motivation
ctags: which drove the development of Exuberant Ctags was the need for a
ctags: ctags program which supported generation of tags for all possible
ctags: C language constructs (which no other ctags offers), and because
ctags: most were easily fooled by a number of preprocessor contructs.
