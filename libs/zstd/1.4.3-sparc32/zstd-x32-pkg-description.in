# HOW TO EDIT THIS FILE:
# The "handy ruler" below makes it easier to edit a package description.  Line
# up the first '|' above the ':' following the base package name, and the '|'
# on the right side marks the last column you can put a character in.  You must
# make exactly 11 lines for the formatting to be correct.  It's also
# customary to leave one space after the ':'.

zstd-x32: zstd-x32 @VERSION@ (real-time compression algorithm)
zstd-x32:
zstd-x32: Zstandard, or zstd for short, is a real-time compression algorithm
zstd-x32: providing high compression ratios. It offers a very wide range of
zstd-x32: compression/speed trade-off, while being backed by a very fast
zstd-x32: decoder. It also offers a special mode for small data, called
zstd-x32: dictionary compression, and can create dictionaries from any
zstd-x32: sample set.
