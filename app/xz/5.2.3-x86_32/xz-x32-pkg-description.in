# HOW TO EDIT THIS FILE:
# The "handy ruler" below makes it easier to edit a package description.  Line
# up the first '|' above the ':' following the base package name, and the '|'
# on the right side marks the last column you can put a character in.  You must
# make exactly 11 lines for the formatting to be correct.  It's also
# customary to leave one space after the ':'.

xz-x32: xz-x32 @VERSION@ (compression utility based on the LZMA algorithm)
xz-x32:
xz-x32: LZMA is a general purpose compression algorithm designed by Igor
xz-x32: Pavlov as part of 7-Zip.  It provides high compression ratio while
xz-x32: keeping the decompression speed fast.  XZ Utils are an attempt to
xz-x32: make LZMA compression easy to use on free (as in freedom) operating
xz-x32: systems.

xz-x32: The people most responsible for xz are Igor Pavlov, Ville Koskinen,
xz-x32: and Lasse Collin.  For more info:  http://tukaani.org/xz/
