# HOW TO EDIT THIS FILE:
# The "handy ruler" below makes it easier to edit a package description.  Line
# up the first '|' above the ':' following the base package name, and the '|'
# on the right side marks the last column you can put a character in.  You must
# make exactly 11 lines for the formatting to be correct.  It's also
# customary to leave one space after the ':'.

netdate: netdate @VERSION@ (simple network time utility)
netdate:
netdate: Netdate takes a list of names of Internet hosts as arguments,
netdate: selects the one which supplies the best time, and sets the system
netdate: time accordingly. The invoker must be the super-user for the time to
netdate: be set. Protocol names (either udp or tcp) may be interspersed with
netdate: the host names, and determine the protocol which will be used to
netdate: connect to the hosts whose names follow, up to the next protocol
netdate: name or the end of the arguments. The default protocol is udp.
