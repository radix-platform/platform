.SH NAME
.B @WORDLIST@
\- a list of English words
.SH DESCRIPTION
.B /usr/share/dict/@WORDLIST@
is an ASCII file which contains an alphabetic list of words, one per
line.
.SH FILES
The directory
.I /usr/share/dict
can contain word lists for many languages.
.I /usr/share/dict/words
is a symbolic link to the currently-chosen
.I /usr/share/dict/<language>
file.
.PP
Word lists for other languages may be added using the English name for
that language, e.g.,
.IR /usr/share/dict/french ,
.IR /usr/share/dict/danish ,
etc.
These should, if possible, use an ISO 8859 character set which is appropriate
for the language in question; if possible the Latin1 (ISO 8859-1) character set
should be used (this is often not possible).

of sources.
