# HOW TO EDIT THIS FILE:
# The "handy ruler" below makes it easier to edit a package description.  Line
# up the first '|' above the ':' following the base package name, and the '|'
# on the right side marks the last column you can put a character in.  You must
# make exactly 11 lines for the formatting to be correct.  It's also
# customary to leave one space after the ':'.

netkit-rwho: The rwho command produces output similar to who, but for all
netkit-rwho: machines on the local network. If no report has been received from
netkit-rwho: a machine for 11 minutes then rwho assumes the machine is down, and
netkit-rwho: does not report users last known to be logged into that machine.
netkit-rwho: If a users hasn't typed to the system for a minute or more, then
netkit-rwho: rwho reports this idle time. If a user hasn't typed to the system
netkit-rwho: for an hour or more, then the user will be omitted from the output
netkit-rwho: of rwho unless the -a flag is given.
