# HOW TO EDIT THIS FILE:
# The "handy ruler" below makes it easier to edit a package description.  Line
# up the first '|' above the ':' following the base package name, and the '|'
# on the right side marks the last column you can put a character in.  You must
# make exactly 11 lines for the formatting to be correct.  It's also
# customary to leave one space after the ':'.

hwloc-x32: hwloc-x32 @VERSION@ (x86_32 Portable Hardware Locality)
hwloc-x32:
hwloc-x32: The Portable Hardware Locality (hwloc) software package provides a
hwloc-x32: portable abstraction (across OS, versions, architectures, ...) of
hwloc-x32: the hierarchical topology of modern architectures, including NUMA
hwloc-x32: memory nodes, sockets, shared caches, cores and simultaneous
hwloc-x32: multithreading. It also gathers various system attributes such as
hwloc-x32: cache and memory information as well as the locality of I/O devices
hwloc-x32: such as network interfaces, InfiniBand HCAs or GPUs.
