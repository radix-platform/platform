# HOW TO EDIT THIS FILE:
# The "handy ruler" below makes it easier to edit a package description.  Line
# up the first '|' above the ':' following the base package name, and the '|'
# on the right side marks the last column you can put a character in.  You must
# make exactly 11 lines for the formatting to be correct.  It's also
# customary to leave one space after the ':'.

tftp-hpa:
tftp-hpa: The Trivial File Transfer Protocol (TFTP) is normally used only for
tftp-hpa: booting diskless workstations. The tftp package provides the user
tftp-hpa: interface for TFTP, which allows users to transfer files to and from
tftp-hpa: a remote machine.  This program and TFTP provide very little
tftp-hpa: security, and should not be enabled unless it is expressly needed.
