# HOW TO EDIT THIS FILE:
# The "handy ruler" below makes it easier to edit a package description.  Line
# up the first '|' above the ':' following the base package name, and the '|'
# on the right side marks the last column you can put a character in.  You must
# make exactly 11 lines for the formatting to be correct.  It's also
# customary to leave one space after the ':'.

judy: The Judy family of functions supports fully dynamic arrays.
judy: These arrays may be indexed by a 32- or 64-bit word (depending
judy: on processor word size), a null terminated string or an
judy: array-of-bytes plus length. A dynamic array (sparsely populated)
judy: can also be thought of as a mapping function or associative
judy: memory.
