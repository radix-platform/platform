# HOW TO EDIT THIS FILE:
# The "handy ruler" below makes it easier to edit a package description.  Line
# up the first '|' above the ':' following the base package name, and the '|'
# on the right side marks the last column you can put a character in.  You must
# make exactly 11 lines for the formatting to be correct.  It's also
# customary to leave one space after the ':'.

libtheora-x32: libtheora-x32 @VERSION@ (x86_32 Theora video codec library)
libtheora-x32:
libtheora-x32: Theora is Xiph.Org's first publicly released video codec, intended
libtheora-x32: for use within the Foundation's Ogg multimedia streaming system.
libtheora-x32: The Theora bitstream format was frozen after the alpha3 release.
libtheora-x32: This means that files produced by the alpha3 encoder will always be
libtheora-x32: playable according to the Theora I specification. Traditionally
libtheora-x32: alpha means a proof of concept, not a production-ready release.
libtheora-x32: However the code is very robust, ready for and indeed in general
libtheora-x32: use.
