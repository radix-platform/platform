# HOW TO EDIT THIS FILE:
# The "handy ruler" below makes it easier to edit a package description.  Line
# up the first '|' above the ':' following the base package name, and the '|'
# on the right side marks the last column you can put a character in.  You must
# make exactly 11 lines for the formatting to be correct.  It's also
# customary to leave one space after the ':'.

texinfo: 'Texinfo' is a documentation system that uses a single source
texinfo: file to produce both on-line information and printed output. Using
texinfo: Texinfo, you can create a printed document with the normal features
texinfo: of a book, including chapters, sections, cross references, and
texinfo: indices. From the same Texinfo source file, you can create a
texinfo: menu-driven, on-line Info file with nodes, menus, cross references,
texinfo: and indices.
