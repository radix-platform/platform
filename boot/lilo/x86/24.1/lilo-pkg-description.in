# HOW TO EDIT THIS FILE:
# The "handy ruler" below makes it easier to edit a package description.  Line
# up the first '|' above the ':' following the base package name, and the '|'
# on the right side marks the last column you can put a character in.  You must
# make exactly 11 lines for the formatting to be correct.  It's also
# customary to leave one space after the ':'.

lilo: lilo @VERSION@ (Linux Loader)
lilo:
lilo: Generic Linux Boot Loader ('LInux LOader') by Werner Almesberger.
lilo: LILO boots Linux from your hard drive. It can also boot other
lilo: operating systems such as MS-DOS and OS/2, and can even boot DOS
lilo: from the second hard drive. LILO comes with utilities and
lilo: documentation that make it easier to install, such as 'liloconfig'
lilo: and 'QuickStart'. NOTE: Installing boot loaders is inherently
lilo: dangerous. Be sure to have some means to boot your system from a
lilo: different media if you install LILO on your hard disk.
