# HOW TO EDIT THIS FILE:
# The "handy ruler" below makes it easier to edit a package description.  Line
# up the first '|' above the ':' following the base package name, and the '|'
# on the right side marks the last column you can put a character in.  You must
# make exactly 11 lines for the formatting to be correct.  It's also
# customary to leave one space after the ':'.

attr32: attr32 @VERSION@ (tools for using extended attributes on filesystems)
attr32:
attr32: This package contains a set of tools for manipulating extended
attr32: attributes (name:value pairs associated permanently with files
attr32: and directories) on filesystem objects, and the library and
attr32: header files needed to develop programs which make use of extended
attr32: attributes. Extended attributes are used to provide additional
attr32: functionality to a filesystem. For example, Access Control Lists
attr32: (ACLs) are implemented using extended attributes.
