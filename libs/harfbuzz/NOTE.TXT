The 'harfbuzz' package in this directory  has been created to resolve ring in the
requires tree. The 'freetype' requires 'harfbuzz' and here we create 'harfbuzz'
package which configured to be enought for 'freetype' functionality reqired by
'Xft', 'Xfont'. When we create 'ghostscript', 'librsvg', 'gtk2+',  ...  we will
build the final 'X11/libs/cairo' and then 'X11/libs/harfbuzz' for installation
to the root file system.
