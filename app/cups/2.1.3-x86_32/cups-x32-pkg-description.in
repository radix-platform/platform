# HOW TO EDIT THIS FILE:
# The "handy ruler" below makes it easier to edit a package description.  Line
# up the first '|' above the ':' following the base package name, and the '|'
# on the right side marks the last column you can put a character in.  You must
# make exactly 11 lines for the formatting to be correct.  It's also
# customary to leave one space after the ':'.

cups-x32:
cups-x32: The Common UNIX Printing System provides a portable printing layer
cups-x32: for UNIX(R)-like operating systems. It has been developed by Easy
cups-x32: Software Products to promote a standard printing solution for all
cups-x32: UNIX vendors and users. CUPS uses the Internet Printing Protocol
cups-x32: ("IPP") as the basis for managing print jobs and queues. The CUPS
cups-x32: package includes System V and Berkeley command-line interfaces, a
cups-x32: PostScript RIP package for supporting non-PostScript printers, and
cups-x32: tools for creating additional printer drivers and CUPS services.
