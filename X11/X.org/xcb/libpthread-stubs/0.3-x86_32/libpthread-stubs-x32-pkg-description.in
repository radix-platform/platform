# HOW TO EDIT THIS FILE:
# The "handy ruler" below makes it easier to edit a package description.  Line
# up the first '|' above the ':' following the base package name, and the '|'
# on the right side marks the last column you can put a character in.  You must
# make exactly 11 lines for the formatting to be correct.  It's also
# customary to leave one space after the ':'.

libpthread-stubs-x32: libpthread-stubs-x32 @VERSION@ (thread support stubs)
libpthread-stubs-x32:
libpthread-stubs-x32: This library provides weak aliases for pthread functions not
libpthread-stubs-x32: provided in libc or otherwise available by default. Libraries
libpthread-stubs-x32: like libxcb rely on pthread stubs to use pthreads optionally,
libpthread-stubs-x32: becoming thread-safe when linked to libpthread, while avoiding
libpthread-stubs-x32: any performance hit when running single-threaded.
