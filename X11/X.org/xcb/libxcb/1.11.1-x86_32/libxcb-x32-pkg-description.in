# HOW TO EDIT THIS FILE:
# The "handy ruler" below makes it easier to edit a package description.  Line
# up the first '|' above the ':' following the base package name, and the '|'
# on the right side marks the last column you can put a character in.  You must
# make exactly 11 lines for the formatting to be correct.  It's also
# customary to leave one space after the ':'.

libxcb-x32: libxcb-x32 @VERSION@ (X protocol C-language Binding)
libxcb-x32:
libxcb-x32: The XCB library provides an interface to the X Window System
libxcb-x32: protocol which is fully capable of replacing Xlib. In fact, libX11
libxcb-x32: makes use of libxcb as much as possible.  :-)  Porting to XCB has
libxcb-x32: several advantages such as a smaller memory footprint, latency
libxcb-x32: hiding, direct protocol access, and improved thread support.
