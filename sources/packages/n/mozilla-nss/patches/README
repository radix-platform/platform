   nss-3.19.2-build-tree.patch - build-system defines the BUILD_TREE variable if make target is 'all'.
                                 NSS source code also check BUILD_TREE defined for building external NSS
                                 (see: mozilla-release/config/external/nss) but this variable is checked
                                 incorrectly in all *.mk files of NSS.
                                 So, this patch is required for building NSS ouside of Firefox sources.
