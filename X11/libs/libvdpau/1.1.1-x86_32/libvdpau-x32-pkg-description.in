# HOW TO EDIT THIS FILE:
# The "handy ruler" below makes it easier to edit a package description.  Line
# up the first '|' above the ':' following the base package name, and the '|'
# on the right side marks the last column you can put a character in.  You must
# make exactly 11 lines for the formatting to be correct.  It's also
# customary to leave one space after the ':'.

libvdpau-x32: libvdpau-x32 @VERSION@ (VDPAU wrapper library)
libvdpau-x32:
libvdpau-x32: This package contains the libvdpau wrapper library and the
libvdpau-x32: libvdpau_trace debugging library, along with the header files
libvdpau-x32: needed to build VDPAU applications. To actually use a VDPAU
libvdpau-x32: device, you need a vendor-specific implementation library,
libvdpau-x32: like the one shipped with nvidia's binary graphics driver.
