Protect su with pam_wheel:
=========================

You need to add a new group "wheel" to your system.

   # addgroup --system wheel

Add users that should be able to su to this group.

   # usermod -a -G wheel user1

Then add the following line to /etc/pam.d/su:

   auth requisite pam_wheel.so group=wheel

Other users will not be able to become root, they
 willget a denied message if they try to become root.

test1@deby:~$ su -
su: Permission denied

If you want wheel members to be able to su without
a password add the following.

   auth sufficient pam_wheel.so group=wheel trust use_uid
.
