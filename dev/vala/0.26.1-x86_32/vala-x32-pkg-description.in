# HOW TO EDIT THIS FILE:
# The "handy ruler" below makes it easier to edit a package description.  Line
# up the first '|' above the ':' following the base package name, and the '|'
# on the right side marks the last column you can put a character in.  You must
# make exactly 11 lines for the formatting to be correct.  It's also
# customary to leave one space after the ':'.

vala-x32:
vala-x32: Vala is a new programming language that aims to bring modern
vala-x32: programming language features to GNOME developers without imposing
vala-x32: any additional runtime requirements and without using a different
vala-x32: ABI compared to applications and libraries written in C. valac, the
vala-x32: Vala compiler, is a self-hosting compiler that translates Vala
vala-x32: source code into C source and header files. It uses the GObject
vala-x32: type system to create classes and interfaces declared in the Vala
vala-x32: source code.
