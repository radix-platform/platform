# HOW TO EDIT THIS FILE:
# The "handy ruler" below makes it easier to edit a package description.  Line
# up the first '|' above the ':' following the base package name, and the '|'
# on the right side marks the last column you can put a character in.  You must
# make exactly 11 lines for the formatting to be correct.  It's also
# customary to leave one space after the ':'.

fastjar: fastjar @VERSION@ (fast jar command)
fastjar:
fastjar: FastJar is an attempt at creating a feature-for-feature copy of
fastjar: Sun's JDK's 'jar' command.  Sun's jar (or Blackdown's for that
fastjar: matter) is written entirely in Java which makes it dog slow.
fastjar: Since FastJar is written in C, it can create the same .jar file
fastjar: as Sun's tool in a fraction of the time.
