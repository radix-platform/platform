# HOW TO EDIT THIS FILE:
# The "handy ruler" below makes it easier to edit a package description.  Line
# up the first '|' above the ':' following the base package name, and the '|'
# on the right side marks the last column you can put a character in.  You must
# make exactly 11 lines for the formatting to be correct.  It's also
# customary to leave one space after the ':'.

libepoxy-x32: libepoxy-x32 @VERSION@ (OpenGL function pointer management)
libepoxy-x32:
libepoxy-x32: Epoxy is a library for handling OpenGL function pointer management.
libepoxy-x32: It hides the complexity of dlopen(), dlsym(), glXGetProcAddress(),
libepoxy-x32: eglGetProcAddress(), etc. from the app developer, with very little
libepoxy-x32: knowledge needed on their part. They get to read GL specs and write
libepoxy-x32: code using undecorated function names like glCompileShader().
