   qt5-5.7.0-mips32r5.patch        - this patch fixes the issue with providing CFLAGS to the
                                     QtWebEngine build system. This patch is relevant to the
                                     Imagination cores of jz47xx and Baikal T1 processors which
                                     based on Xburst and p5600 cores. For P5600 core we have to
                                     use -march=mips32r5 -mtune=p5600 (GCC 5.3.0) or
                                     -march=p5600 (GCC 5.4.0). In this patch we keep GCC 5.3.0
                                     options schema (-march=mips32r5 -mtune=p5600) which is
                                     applicable for both versions of GCC.

   qt5-5.7.0-arm-neon-thumb.patch  - Clear default value arm_thumb=1 for arm_version=7 and
                                     check QMAKE_CFLAGS for -mthumb option.  If -mthumb is
                                     not present in QMAKE_CFLAGS the  arm_thumb value will
                                     be equal to 0 (zero). Also this patch responsible for
                                     correct FPU options passed to WebEngine.

   qt5-5.7.0-ffmpeg-no-thumb.patch - this patch is needed if the -mthumb option is not set
                                     (i.e. the -mthumb option is not present in QMAKE_CFLAGS).

   qt5-5.7.0-ffmpeg-no-armv6.patch - disable armv5te, armv6 inline assembler to avoid errors
                                     related incorrect usage of thumb mode.
