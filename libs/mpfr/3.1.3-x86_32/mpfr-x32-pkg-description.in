# HOW TO EDIT THIS FILE:
# The "handy ruler" below makes it easier to edit a package description.  Line
# up the first '|' above the ':' following the base package name, and the '|'
# on the right side marks the last column you can put a character in.  You must
# make exactly 11 lines for the formatting to be correct.  It's also
# customary to leave one space after the ':'.

mpfr-x32: mpfr-x32 @VERSION@ (x86_32 Floating-Point Reliable Library)
mpfr-x32:
mpfr-x32: The MPFR library is a C library for multiple-precision floating-point
mpfr-x32: computations with exact rounding (also called correct rounding).
mpfr-x32: It is based on the GMP multiple-precision library.
mpfr-x32: The main goal of MPFR is to provide a library for multiple-precision
mpfr-x32: floating-point computation which is both efficient and has 
mpfr-x32: well-defined semantics.  It copies the good ideas from the
mpfr-x32: ANSI/IEEE-754 standard for double-precision floating-point arithmetic
mpfr-x32: (53-bit mantissa).
