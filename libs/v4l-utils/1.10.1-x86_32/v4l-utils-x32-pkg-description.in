# HOW TO EDIT THIS FILE:
# The "handy ruler" below makes it easier to edit a package description.  Line
# up the first '|' above the ':' following the base package name, and the '|'
# on the right side marks the last column you can put a character in.  You must
# make exactly 11 lines for the formatting to be correct.  It's also
# customary to leave one space after the ':'.

v4l-utils-x32: v4l-utils-x32 @VERSION@ (libraries and utilities for video4linux)
v4l-utils-x32:
v4l-utils-x32: libv4l is a collection of libraries which adds a thin abstraction
v4l-utils-x32: layer on top of video4linux2 devices. The purpose of this (thin)
v4l-utils-x32: layer is to make it easy for application writers to support a wide
v4l-utils-x32: variety of devices without having to write separate code for
v4l-utils-x32: different devices in the same class. Linux V4L2 and DVB API
v4l-utils-x32: utilities are also included.
