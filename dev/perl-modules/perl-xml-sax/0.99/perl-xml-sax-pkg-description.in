# HOW TO EDIT THIS FILE:
# The "handy ruler" below makes it easier to edit a package description.  Line
# up the first '|' above the ':' following the base package name, and the '|'
# on the right side marks the last column you can put a character in.  You must
# make exactly 11 lines for the formatting to be correct.  It's also
# customary to leave one space after the ':'.

perl-xml-sax: perl-xml-sax @VERSION@ (XML::SAX)
perl-xml-sax:
perl-xml-sax: XML::SAX consists of several framework classes for using and
perl-xml-sax: building Perl SAX2 XML parsers, filters, and drivers. It is designed
perl-xml-sax: around the need to be able to "plug in" different SAX parsers to an
perl-xml-sax: application without requiring programmer intervention. Those of you
perl-xml-sax: familiar with the DBI will be right at home. Some of the designs
perl-xml-sax: come from the Java JAXP specification (SAX part), only without
perl-xml-sax: the javaness.
