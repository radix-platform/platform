   avahi-0.6.31-dnsconfd.patch:
   ---------------------------
     avahi-dnsconfd.action looks for /sbin/netconfig, and if found, attempts to 
     use it to modify /etc/resolv.conf.  While *our* netconfig and SuSE's
     netconfig started out the same, they're quite different these days, and
     thus the result is /etc/HOSTNAME getting set to some nonsense such as:
       INTERFACE='eth0'.DNSSERVERS='192.168.13.1'
     This was quite some fun tracking down, by the way...  :-)  --rworkman
