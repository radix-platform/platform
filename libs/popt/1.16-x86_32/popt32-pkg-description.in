# HOW TO EDIT THIS FILE:
# The "handy ruler" below makes it easier to edit a package description.  Line
# up the first '|' above the ':' following the base package name, and the '|'
# on the right side marks the last column you can put a character in.  You must
# make exactly 11 lines for the formatting to be correct.  It's also
# customary to leave one space after the ':'.

popt32: popt32 @VERSION@ (command line parsing library)
popt32:
popt32: Popt is a C library for parsing command line parameters. Popt was
popt32: heavily influenced by the getopt() and getopt_long() functions, but
popt32: it improves on them by allowing more powerful argument expansion.
popt32: Popt can parse arbitrary argv[] style arrays and automatically set
popt32: variables based on command line arguments.  Popt allows command line
popt32: arguments to be aliased via configuration files and includes utility
popt32: functions for parsing arbitrary strings into argv[] arrays using
popt32: shell-like rules.
