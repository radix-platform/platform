# HOW TO EDIT THIS FILE:
# The "handy ruler" below makes it easier to edit a package description.  Line
# up the first '|' above the ':' following the base package name, and the '|'
# on the right side marks the last column you can put a character in.  You must
# make exactly 11 lines for the formatting to be correct.  It's also
# customary to leave one space after the ':'.

libsamplerate-x32: libsamplerate-x32 @VERSION@ (a Sample Rate Converter for audio)
libsamplerate-x32:
libsamplerate-x32: Secret Rabbit Code (aka libsamplerate) is a Sample Rate Converter
libsamplerate-x32: for audio. One example of where such a thing would be useful is
libsamplerate-x32: converting audio from the CD sample rate of 44.1kHz to the 48kHz
libsamplerate-x32: sample rate used by DAT players.  SRC is capable of arbitrary and
libsamplerate-x32: time varying conversions.  SRC provides a small set of converters
libsamplerate-x32: to allow quality to be traded off against computation cost.
