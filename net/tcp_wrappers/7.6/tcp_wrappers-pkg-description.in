# HOW TO EDIT THIS FILE:
# The "handy ruler" below makes it easier to edit a package description.  Line
# up the first '|' above the ':' following the base package name, and the '|'
# on the right side marks the last column you can put a character in.  You must
# make exactly 11 lines for the formatting to be correct.  It's also
# customary to leave one space after the ':'.

tcp_wrappers: The tcp_wrappers allows you to monitor and filter incoming requests
tcp_wrappers: for network services. It provides tiny daemon wrapper programs that
tcp_wrappers: can be installed without any changes to existing software or to
tcp_wrappers: existing configuration files. The wrappers report the name of the
tcp_wrappers: client host and of the requested service. The wrappers do not
tcp_wrappers: exchange information with the client or server applications, and
tcp_wrappers: impose no overhead on the actual conversation between the client
tcp_wrappers: and server applications.
