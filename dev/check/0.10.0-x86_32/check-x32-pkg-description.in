# HOW TO EDIT THIS FILE:
# The "handy ruler" below makes it easier to edit a package description.  Line
# up the first '|' above the ':' following the base package name, and the '|'
# on the right side marks the last column you can put a character in.  You must
# make exactly 11 lines for the formatting to be correct.  It's also
# customary to leave one space after the ':'.

check-x32:
check-x32: Check is a unit testing framework for C. It features a simple
check-x32: interface for defining unit tests, putting little in the way of
check-x32: the developer. Tests are run in a separate address space, so both
check-x32: assertion failures and code errors that cause segmentation faults
check-x32: or other signals can be caught. Test results are reportable in the
check-x32: following: Subunit, TAP, XML, and a generic logging format.
