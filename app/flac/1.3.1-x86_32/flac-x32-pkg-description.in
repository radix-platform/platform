# HOW TO EDIT THIS FILE:
# The "handy ruler" below makes it easier to edit a package description.  Line
# up the first '|' above the ':' following the base package name, and the '|'
# on the right side marks the last column you can put a character in.  You must
# make exactly 11 lines for the formatting to be correct.  It's also
# customary to leave one space after the ':'.

flac-x32: flac-x32 @VERSION@ (Free Lossless Audio Codec)
flac-x32:
flac-x32: FLAC stands for Free Lossless Audio Codec. Grossly oversimplified,
flac-x32: FLAC is similar to MP3, but lossless. "Free" means that the
flac-x32: specification of the stream format is in the public domain, and that
flac-x32: neither the FLAC format nor any of the implemented encoding/decoding
flac-x32: methods are covered by any patent. It also means that the sources for
flac-x32: libFLAC and libFLAC++ are available under the LGPL and the sources
flac-x32: for flac, metaflac, and the plugins are available under the GPL.
flac-x32: FLAC was developed by Josh Coalson.
