   bluez-5.52-non-LE-devices.patch - adapter: Don't refresh adv_manager for non-LE devices
                                     btd_adv_manager_refresh is called upon MGMT_SETTING_DISCOVERABLE
                                     setting change but as only LE adapters have an adv_manager, this
                                     leads to segmentation fault for non-LE devices.
