# HOW TO EDIT THIS FILE:
# The "handy ruler" below makes it easier to edit a package description.  Line
# up the first '|' above the ':' following the base package name, and the '|'
# on the right side marks the last column you can put a character in.  You must
# make exactly 11 lines for the formatting to be correct.  It's also
# customary to leave one space after the ':'.

pth32:
pth32: Pth is a very portable POSIX/ANSI-C based library for Unix platforms
pth32: which provides non-preemptive priority-based scheduling for multiple
pth32: threads of execution (aka `multithreading') inside event-driven
pth32: applications. All threads run in the same address space of the
pth32: server application, but each thread has its own individual
pth32: program-counter, run-time stack, signal mask and errno variable.
