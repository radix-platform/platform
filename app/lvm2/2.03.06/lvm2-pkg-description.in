# HOW TO EDIT THIS FILE:
# The "handy ruler" below makes it easier to edit a package description.  Line
# up the first '|' above the ':' following the base package name, and the '|'
# on the right side marks the last column you can put a character in.  You must
# make exactly 11 lines for the formatting to be correct.  It's also
# customary to leave one space after the ':'.

lvm2: lvm2 @VERSION@ (Logical Volume Manager version 2)
lvm2:
lvm2: Heinz Mauelshagen's LVM (Logical Volume Manager) for Linux.
lvm2: LVM adds an additional layer between the physical peripherals and
lvm2: the low-level I/O interface to get a logical view of disks. This
lvm2: allows the concatenation of several disks (so-called physical
lvm2: volumes or PVs) to form a storage pool (so-called Volume Group or
lvm2: VG) with allocation units called physical extents (called PE).
lvm2: With LVM, you can extend, resize, or relocate storage dynamically.
