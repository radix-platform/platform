# HOW TO EDIT THIS FILE:
# The "handy ruler" below makes it easier to edit a package description.  Line
# up the first '|' above the ':' following the base package name, and the '|'
# on the right side marks the last column you can put a character in.  You must
# make exactly 11 lines for the formatting to be correct.  It's also
# customary to leave one space after the ':'.

isl-x32:
isl-x32: isl is a thread-safe C library for manipulating sets and relations
isl-x32: of integer points bounded by affine constraints. The descriptions of
isl-x32: the sets and relations may involve both parameters and existentially
