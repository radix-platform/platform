# HOW TO EDIT THIS FILE:
# The "handy ruler" below makes it easier to edit a package description.  Line
# up the first '|' above the ':' following the base package name, and the '|'
# on the right side marks the last column you can put a character in.  You must
# make exactly 11 lines for the formatting to be correct.  It's also
# customary to leave one space after the ':'.

libdri2: libdri2 @VERSION@ (library for the X11 DRI2 extension)
libdri2:
libdri2: Splited out dri2 client side code from mesa, libva, libvdpau, etc...
libdri2:
libdri2: Some distributions have libdri2 compiled into the X11 binary,
libdri2: instead of having it as a separate library and package. If that
libdri2: is the case, you need Rob Clark's libdri2.
