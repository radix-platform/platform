# HOW TO EDIT THIS FILE:
# The "handy ruler" below makes it easier to edit a package description.  Line
# up the first '|' above the ':' following the base package name, and the '|'
# on the right side marks the last column you can put a character in.  You must
# make exactly 11 lines for the formatting to be correct.  It's also
# customary to leave one space after the ':'.

npth-x32: npth-x32 @VERSION@ (x86_32 New GNU Portable Threads)
npth-x32:
npth-x32: This is a library to provide the GNU Pth API and thus
npth-x32: a non-preemptive threads implementation.
npth-x32:
npth-x32: In contrast to GNU Pth is is based on the system's standard threads
npth-x32: implementation.  This allows the use of libraries which are not
npth-x32: compatible to GNU Pth.  Experience with a Windows Pth emulation
npth-x32: showed that this is a solid way to provide a co-routine based
npth-x32: framework.
