# HOW TO EDIT THIS FILE:
# The "handy ruler" below makes it easier to edit a package description.  Line
# up the first '|' above the ':' following the base package name, and the '|'
# on the right side marks the last column you can put a character in.  You must
# make exactly 11 lines for the formatting to be correct.  It's also
# customary to leave one space after the ':'.

pango-x32:
pango-x32: Pango is a library for layout and rendering of text, with an emphasis
pango-x32: on internationalization. Pango can be used anywhere that text layout
pango-x32: is needed; however, most of the work on Pango was done using the GTK+
pango-x32: widget toolkit as a test platform. Pango forms the core of text and
pango-x32: font handling for GTK+-2.
