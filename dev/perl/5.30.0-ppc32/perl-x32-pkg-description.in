# HOW TO EDIT THIS FILE:
# The "handy ruler" below makes it easier to edit a package description.  Line
# up the first '|' above the ':' following the base package name, and the '|'
# on the right side marks the last column you can put a character in.  You must
# make exactly 11 lines for the formatting to be correct.  It's also
# customary to leave one space after the ':'.

perl-x32: perl-x32 @VERSION@ (Practical Extraction and Report Language)
perl-x32:
perl-x32: Larry Wall's "Practical Extraction and Report Language". Perl is
perl-x32: a language optimized for scanning arbitrary text files, extracting
perl-x32: information from those text files, and printing reports based on
perl-x32: that information. It's also a good language for many system
perl-x32: management tasks. The language is intended to be practical (easy to
perl-x32: use, efficient, complete) rather than beautiful (tiny, elegant,
perl-x32: minimal).
