# HOW TO EDIT THIS FILE:
# The "handy ruler" below makes it easier to edit a package description.  Line
# up the first '|' above the ':' following the base package name, and the '|'
# on the right side marks the last column you can put a character in.  You must
# make exactly 11 lines for the formatting to be correct.  It's also
# customary to leave one space after the ':'.

twolame-x32: twolame-x32 @VERSION@ (optimized MPEG Audio Layer 2 encoder)
twolame-x32:
twolame-x32: TwoLAME should be able to be used as a drop-in replacement for
twolame-x32: LAME (a MPEG Layer 3 encoder). The frontend takes very similar
twolame-x32: command line options to LAME, and the backend library has
twolame-x32: a very similar API to LAME.
