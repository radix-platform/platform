Title:		adjtimex - display or set the kernel time variables
Version:	1.29
Entered-date:	2010-04-16
Description:	Display or set the kernel time variables.
This program gives you raw access to the kernel time variables.  For
a machine connected to the Internet, or equipped with a precision
oscillator or radio clock, the best way to keep the system clock
correct is with ntpd.  However, for a standalone or intermittently
connected machine, you may use adjtimex instead to at least correct
for systematic drift.  adjtimex can optionally adjust the system
clock using the CMOS clock as a reference, and can log times for
long-term estimation of drift rates.
Keywords:	time, system clock, hardware clock
