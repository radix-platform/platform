# HOW TO EDIT THIS FILE:
# The "handy ruler" below makes it easier to edit a package description.  Line
# up the first '|' above the ':' following the base package name, and the '|'
# on the right side marks the last column you can put a character in.  You must
# make exactly 11 lines for the formatting to be correct.  It's also
# customary to leave one space after the ':'.

chrpath: chrpath @VERSION@ (Change the RPATH or RUNPATH of ELF binaries)
chrpath:
chrpath: chrpath allows you to modify the dynamic library load path (rpath)
chrpath: of compiled programs.  Currently, only removing and modifying the
chrpath: rpath is supported. Eventually, I hope to be able to add an rpath
chrpath: if it is missing.
