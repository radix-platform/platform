The 'cairo' package in this directory  has been created to resolve ring in the
requires tree. The 'harfbuzz' requires 'cairo' and here we create 'cairo' package
which configured to be enought for 'freetype'-'harfbuzz' functionality reqired by
'Xft', 'Xfont'. When we create 'ghostscript', 'librsvg', 'gtk2+',  ...  we will
build the final 'X11/libs/cairo' for installation to the root file system.
