# HOW TO EDIT THIS FILE:
# The "handy ruler" below makes it easier to edit a package description.  Line
# up the first '|' above the ':' following the base package name, and the '|'
# on the right side marks the last column you can put a character in.  You must
# make exactly 11 lines for the formatting to be correct.  It's also
# customary to leave one space after the ':'.

fftw-x32: fftw-x32 @VERSION@ (x86_32 Discrete Fourier Transform routines)
fftw-x32:
fftw-x32: FFTW is a free collection of fast C routines for computing the
fftw-x32: Discrete Fourier Transform in one or more dimensions. It includes
fftw-x32: complex, real, symmetric, and parallel transforms, and can handle
fftw-x32: arbitrary array sizes efficiently.
