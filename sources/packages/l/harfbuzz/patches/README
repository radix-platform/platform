   harfbuzz-0.9.36-no-eps.patch,
   harfbuzz-1.2.7-no-eps.patch   - used for building harfbuzz without cairo SVG, PDF, PS engines.
                                   This patch required when full functional cairo is installed
                                   into target x86_64 rootfs and we have cairo-{svg,pdf,ps}.h
                                   headers but for x86_32 platform we still have libcairo which
                                   doesn't have SVG, PDF, PS support. In this case we have to apply
                                   this patch to be able build x86_32 libs/harfbuzz.

                                   This patch is not required for X11/libs/harfbuzz !
