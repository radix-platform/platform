# HOW TO EDIT THIS FILE:
# The "handy ruler" below makes it easier to edit a package description.  Line
# up the first '|' above the ':' following the base package name, and the '|'
# on the right side marks the last column you can put a character in.  You must
# make exactly 11 lines for the formatting to be correct.  It's also
# customary to leave one space after the ':'.

xcb-proto-x32: xcb-proto-x32 @VERSION@ (x86_32 XML-XCB protocol descriptions PROTO)
xcb-proto-x32:
xcb-proto-x32: xcb-proto provides the XML-XCB protocol descriptions that libxcb
xcb-proto-x32: uses to generate the majority of its code and API. We provide them
xcb-proto-x32: separately from libxcb to allow reuse by other projects, such as
xcb-proto-x32: additional language bindings, protocol dissectors, or documentation
xcb-proto-x32: generators.
