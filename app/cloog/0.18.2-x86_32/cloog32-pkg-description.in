# HOW TO EDIT THIS FILE:
# The "handy ruler" below makes it easier to edit a package description.  Line
# up the first '|' above the ':' following the base package name, and the '|'
# on the right side marks the last column you can put a character in.  You must
# make exactly 11 lines for the formatting to be correct.  It's also
# customary to leave one space after the ':'.

cloog32: CLooG is a free software and library to generate code for scanning
cloog32: Z-polyhedra. That is, it finds a code (e.g. in C, FORTRAN...) that
cloog32: reaches each integral point of one or more parameterized polyhedra.
cloog32: CLooG has been originally written to solve the code generation
cloog32: problem for optimizing compilers based on the polytope model.
