The English word lists (words-en_US*, words-en_GB*, words-en_CA*) and
the 'scowl' package are all built from the upstream SCOWL word lists.
See the SCOWL package's copyright file 'scowl/Copiright' here for more
details about SCOWL.

The 'scowl' package installs the raw SCOWL 'scowl-@VERSION@/final/'
word lists into '/usr/share/dict/scowl' directory.
See '/usr/share/doc/scowl-@VERSION@/README' or 'scowl/README' here
for documentation about those individual word list files.

For the English word lists, we use an appropriate collection of SCOWL
word lists for each specific language/spelling and complexity. The file
'/usr/share/doc/words/@PACKAGE@-@VERSION@/@PACKAGE@.scowl-wordlists'
lists the specific scowl files that were used to create the
'@PACKAGE@-@VERSION@' word list.
