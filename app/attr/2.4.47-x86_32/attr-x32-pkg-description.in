# HOW TO EDIT THIS FILE:
# The "handy ruler" below makes it easier to edit a package description.  Line
# up the first '|' above the ':' following the base package name, and the '|'
# on the right side marks the last column you can put a character in.  You must
# make exactly 11 lines for the formatting to be correct.  It's also
# customary to leave one space after the ':'.

attr-x32: attr-x32 @VERSION@ (x86_32 tools for using extended attributes on FS)
attr-x32:
attr-x32: This package contains a set of tools for manipulating extended
attr-x32: attributes (name:value pairs associated permanently with files
attr-x32: and directories) on filesystem objects, and the library and
attr-x32: header files needed to develop programs which make use of extended
attr-x32: attributes. Extended attributes are used to provide additional
attr-x32: functionality to a filesystem. For example, Access Control Lists
attr-x32: (ACLs) are implemented using extended attributes.
