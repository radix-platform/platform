# HOW TO EDIT THIS FILE:
# The "handy ruler" below makes it easier to edit a package description.  Line
# up the first '|' above the ':' following the base package name, and the '|'
# on the right side marks the last column you can put a character in.  You must
# make exactly 11 lines for the formatting to be correct.  It's also
# customary to leave one space after the ':'.

xkeyboard-config: The X Keyboard Extension essentially replaces the core protocol
xkeyboard-config: definition of keyboard. The extension makes possible to clearly
xkeyboard-config: and explicitly specify most aspects of keyboard behaviour on
xkeyboard-config: per-key basis and to more closely track the logical and physical
xkeyboard-config: state of the keyboard. It also includes a number of keyboard
xkeyboard-config: controls designed to make keyboards more accessible to people
xkeyboard-config: with physical impairments.
