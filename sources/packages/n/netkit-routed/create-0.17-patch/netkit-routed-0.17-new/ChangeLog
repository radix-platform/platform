25-Dec-2000:
	Bug fix - on newer kernels, don't attempt to add direct
	  interface-routes to KRT - assume they're always present.
	Bug fix - corrected handling of direct interface-routes
	  in rtioctl(): use rt.rt_dev entry instead of rt.rt_gateway
	  for these (was old BSDism).
	Bug fix - do not add routes to remote subnets with netmask
	  set to 255.255.255.255, when pointopoint interfaces whose
	  IP belongs to the same network class as IP of another
	  non-pointopoint interface, are in use.
	Feature change - do not "timeout" interface-routes even if we
	  act as route supplier.
	Feature change - removed arbitrary limit on number of interfaces
	  that routed can look up in rtinit().
	New feature - introduced "announced" type of distant gateways
	  for use in "gateways" file.
	New feature - introduced command-line flag "-p" to ignore
	  all interfaces with IFF_POINTOPOINT set.
	New feature - introduced command-line flag "-i <dev>" to ignore
	  given network interface <dev>.
	Routed manpage upgraded accordingly. (Jan Rafaj, rafaj@vabo.cz)

8-May-1998:
	Added a security 'feature' to routed that prevents it writing any

	  it's trying to create.
