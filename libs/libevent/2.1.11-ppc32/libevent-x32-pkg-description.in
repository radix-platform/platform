# HOW TO EDIT THIS FILE:
# The "handy ruler" below makes it easier to edit a package description.  Line
# up the first '|' above the ':' following the base package name, and the '|'
# on the right side marks the last column you can put a character in.  You must
# make exactly 11 lines for the formatting to be correct.  It's also
# customary to leave one space after the ':'.

libevent-x32: libevent-x32 @VERSION@ (event loop library)
libevent-x32:
libevent-x32: libevent is meant to replace the event loop found in event driven
libevent-x32: network servers. An application just needs to call event_dispatch()
libevent-x32: and then add or remove events dynamically without having to change
libevent-x32: the event loop. The libevent API provides a mechanism to execute a
libevent-x32: callback function when a specific event occurs on a file descriptor
libevent-x32: or after a timeout has been reached.
