# HOW TO EDIT THIS FILE:
# The "handy ruler" below makes it easier to edit a package description.  Line
# up the first '|' above the ':' following the base package name, and the '|'
# on the right side marks the last column you can put a character in.  You must
# make exactly 11 lines for the formatting to be correct.  It's also
# customary to leave one space after the ':'.

bzip2-x32:
bzip2-x32: Bzip2 compresses files using the Burrows-Wheeler block sorting text
bzip2-x32: compression algorithm, and Huffman coding. Compression is generally
bzip2-x32: considerably better than that achieved by more conventional
bzip2-x32: LZ77/LZ78-based compressors, and approaches the performance of the
bzip2-x32: PPM family of statistical compressors.
