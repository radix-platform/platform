# HOW TO EDIT THIS FILE:
# The "handy ruler" below makes it easier to edit a package description.  Line
# up the first '|' above the ':' following the base package name, and the '|'
# on the right side marks the last column you can put a character in.  You must
# make exactly 11 lines for the formatting to be correct.  It's also
# customary to leave one space after the ':'.

ipset-x32:
ipset-x32: IP sets are a Linux kernel framework administered by the ipset
ipset-x32: utility.  Depending on the type, currently an IP set may store
ipset-x32: IP addresses, (TCP/UDP) port numbers, or IP addresses with MAC
ipset-x32: addresses in a way which ensures lightning speed when matching
ipset-x32: an entry against a set.
