# HOW TO EDIT THIS FILE:
# The "handy ruler" below makes it easier to edit a package description.  Line
# up the first '|' above the ':' following the base package name, and the '|'
# on the right side marks the last column you can put a character in.  You must
# make exactly 11 lines for the formatting to be correct.  It's also
# customary to leave one space after the ':'.

libsoxr:
libsoxr: The SoX Resampler library `libsoxr' performs one-dimensional
libsoxr: sample-rate conversion -- it may be used, for example, to resample
libsoxr: PCM-encoded audio. For higher-dimensional resampling, such as for
libsoxr: visual-image processing, you should look elsewhere.libsoxr:
